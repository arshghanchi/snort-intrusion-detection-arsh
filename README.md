# Custom Snort Intrusion Detection Project

This project is a unique implementation of a network intrusion detection system using **Snort**, carried out by **Mohamed Arsh Mohamed Arif Ghanchi** as part of the **SIT327 - Network Forensics** unit at **Deakin University**. It simulates and analyzes malicious traffic to help identify potential intrusions using custom Snort rules.

## üöÄ Key Capabilities

- Detects ICMP and TCP-based network anomalies
- Custom rules for real-time traffic inspection
- Console-based alerting with log support
- Developed and tested on both Ubuntu and Windows systems
- Includes flowcharts and structured documentation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Usage

### Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Install Snort:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install snort
   ```

2. Configuration:
   - Set `HOME_NET` inside `/etc/snort/snort.conf`
   - Create or edit `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules`

3. Validate:
   ```bash
   sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
   ```

4. Launch:
   ```bash
   sudo snort -A console -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
   ```

### Windows
